Sample of a wxWidgets-based Windows service

This sample of a Windows service was written using wxWidgets 3.0.2 and tested on Windows 7.  I'm sure it will work on some other versions as well.  The Code::Blocks IDE was used, which explains the project file *.cbp in the folder.

The code should be pretty well commented, although Windows services are not terribly easy to follow.

The code was built off of other code and information from these two sources, as well as many trips to the wxWidgets documentation and StackOverflow.

I hope someone finds this useful.
